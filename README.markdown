RequireJS Project Template
==========================

This is a simple project as that the RequireJS [optimization section](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) describes. I've added a simple build.sh that takes one parameter: the project-name. 


## Instructions

Once you have the project cloned

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/nemtsov/requirejs-project-template.git

open **project-one/main.html** in the browser. Notice the number of CSS & JS files that it pulls **(8 in total)**. Then run: 

    ./build.sh project-one 

That will create a directory called **project-one-build/**. Open **project-one-build/main.html** in the browser. You'll see that it will only pull **4 files**. That is because the build-step combines all CSS and JS into the fewest possible number of files.


## More

If you'd like to use **dojo**, take a look at [this template for loading dojo using RequireJS](https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate).
